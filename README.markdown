# activerecord-import

activerecord-import is a library for bulk inserting data using ActiveRecord.

### Rails 4.0

Use activerecord-import 0.4.0 or higher.

### Rails 3.1.x up to, but not including 4.0

Use the latest in the activerecord-import 0.3.x series.

### Rails 3.0.x up to, but not including 3.1

Use activerecord-import 0.2.11. As of activerecord-import 0.3.0 we are relying on functionality that was introduced in Rails 3.1. Since Rails 3.0.x is no longer a supported version of Rails we have decided to drop support as well.
